*Final Outcome Goals:
Once provided a CRN, we can represent the molecules as little balls of different colors and labels bouncing around in given container. (i.e. a small window to begin with) The size of the container will change with respect to the change initial state concentration. 
Parse the CRN format that COPASI uses from files

TimeLine:
	Now 17 (Fri): 
		Project proposal
	Nov 20 (Mon):
		Carol & Liat have basic understanding of ruby (follow the gosu library)
		5 sample CRN’s from copasi for example and parsing 
			A → B
			Logic Gates (7 basic) 
			A → B & B → A
			A + B → C
			Max function
	Nov 27 (Mon):
		Carol & Liat have better understanding of ruby
		Sample Mock up of program (see below)
		Read and write
		Box with circles ( movement if possible)
		Test at bottom (not necessarily updating) 
	Dec 4 (Mon):
		Project write up and final project done
	Dec 6 (Fri):
		Project due YAYAYAYA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Code Outline
	Parse and write to files 
		Parse copasi format and write to original file
	Visualizer
		What is it going to look like?
			Big box
			Molecules (circles)
				Different color for each species
			Species counts at the bottom of the screen
		What can the user set?
			Temperature (speed of the molecules
			Type of species and concentrations
			Rate constant (if we have time) (extra credit)
			Volume (size of box) 
				Have a scale of 1 to 10 to choose from
		What is going to be fixed?
			Bottom display with concentration
	Other features?
		When molecule bounces off the side of container, we want to change the angle slightly (so its not stuck in a loop)
