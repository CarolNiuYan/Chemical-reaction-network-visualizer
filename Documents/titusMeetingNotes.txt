Notes from meeting with Titus Wed, Nov 22, 2017

	TL;DR
		write our own CRN file format and parse that instead of the Copasi output file
		rate constant = 0<= p <= 1 for 2-molecule reaction that a reaction will happen when molecules colide
					  = minimum time that must elapse before reaction for 1-molecule reaction
		don't deal with reactions with more than 2 molecules

	Parser: "don't write our own parser, that sounds like torture" -Titus
		nokogiri: premade parser that Titus suggested to parse the Copasi output file
			or
		create our own format for CRN's and parse them with ease
			because copasi output file has lots of information that we will not need to use 
	
	Regarding Rate Constants: 
		for two molucule reactions the r.c. should be a propability that a reaction takes place when the necessary reactants colide
		for sigle molucule reactions the r.c. is a minimum time that must elapse before a reaction
			to begin with, we can program the reaction to take place immediatley after this time inteval
			if we can, make it so that the probability after this time interval is greater than zero and keeps increasing untill it hits 1 or the reaction happens
			
	Only deal with 1 and 2 molucule reactions
	
	if multiple reactions have the same inputs and those inputs colide, randomly choose a reaction from the possible reactions
