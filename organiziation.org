* How this is all getting organized
** CRN Model
*** Classes:
    Overall we need to keep track of:
     - Window size
     - Starting positions
     - Starting velocities
     - Bounce angles
     - Species
     - Reactions
    to create reproducable reactions, and as such our model should account for these.
**** Species:
     - Simply modeled as _dict_ [:species_name] of (_dict_ [frame_number] (count))
     - count is amount of species at frame_number, new frame_numbers are only added when changes occur to the species
     - Seperatly keep track of a list of all frames at which changes occur
**** Reaction:
     - _dict_ inputs -- Keys: species names; Values: count
     - _dict_ outputs -- Keys: species names; Values: count
     - _int_ reaction_speed -- Amount of time it takes for this reaction to occur
     - _list
