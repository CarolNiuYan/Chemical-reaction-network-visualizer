* How this is all getting organized
** CRN Model
*** Classes:
    Overall we need to keep track of:
     - Window size
     - Starting positions
     - Starting velocities
     - Bounce angles
     - Species
     - Reactions
    to create reproducable reactions, and as such our model should account for these.

**** Molecule:
     - Not imported from .cps model
     - Tied to/inheits some gosu object
     - _list[double]_ bounce angles
     - _point_ start_pos -- starting position -- immutable
     - _point_ start_velocity -- starting velocity -- immutable
     - _point_ cur_pos -- current position -- mutable
     - _point_ cur_velocity -- current velocity -- mutable
    
**** Species:
     - Seperatly keep track of a list of all frames at which changes occur
     - _Gosu::Color_ color -- color of the Molecule
     - _str_ label -- displayed string on top of all molecules of this type
     - _str_ name -- Species name - must be unique
     - _dict_ counts -- Dict with a new _int_ at every frame where the count of this species changes for graphing purposes
     - _list[molecule]_ molecules -- a list of all molecules that are a part of this species at any point in time
     - Null is not needed - just say things go to nothing
**** Reaction:
     - _dict_ inputs -- Keys: species names; Values: count
     - _dict_ outputs -- Keys: species names; Values: count
     - _int_ reaction_speed -- Amount of time it takes for this reaction to occur

**** TODO: Graphics class nonsense

*** Problems to solve:
**** Graphics
     - How do we keep track of how the molecules split?
       - Maybe they always go out the same way (i.e. same angle between all)
     - How do we make sure that they don't immediately collide upon splitting?
     - How do we handle the speed of a reaction? Do molecules sometimes not react when the collide?
     - What, if anything, gets shown alongside the reaction as it executes?
